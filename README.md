# 🏥 Medicly - Your health in your hands 🏥

## About

Medicly was a project by Janine Luk ([ja9-look](https://github.com/ja9-look)), Kevin Sutton ([kevmsutton](https://github.com/Kevmsutton)) and Jack Ling ([Lingy94](https://github.com/Lingy94)).

This app was created using Ruby on Rails, to provide users a convenient place to keep track of all their medical records.

### MVP

1. User should be able to login/ sign up
2. User should be able to see all doctors
3. User should be able to see show page of doctor
4. User should be able to create/edit a new doctor
5. User should be able to create/edit an appointment (optional note) with selected doctor
6. User should be able to edit their personal information
7. User should be able to create/view their appointments

### Stretch Goals

In order to further improve our app, we want to:

1. User can search for specific doctors
2. User should be able to filter their appointments by type
3. App looks nice + user-friendly
4. Responsive app for mobile
